		<p>Corinna came to yoga when she was seventeen years old. What she experienced during her yoga classes stayed with her, and later inspired her to do a 200-hour Vinyasa Teacher Training in Tuebingen in 2013. Among her teachers are Alexandra Becker and Roland Jensch. As a student of sports and sports medicine, Corinna pays great attention to body alignment in her yoga classes, but believes it is crucial to be considerate of the uniqueness of each individual. She is eager to help her students find what feels good, have fun in her classes, break a little sweat and feel light and relaxed after their yoga practice.</p>
