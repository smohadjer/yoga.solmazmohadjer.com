		<h2>Alex Immel (guest teacher)</h2>
		<p>Alex started breakdancing at the age of 14 and in spite of several pausing periods in his practice, he always found his way back to it. What draws him to bboying is the freedom of movement and open-mindedness that can ultimately break down the boundaries of assumed limitations, physical and mental. He believes bboying is about expression, focus, power and self-control and together with yoga it can enhance one's own body perception and self-confidence. Alex has been sharing his knowledge of breakdance with students of all levels since 2005. As a guest teacher at Inf√∂, he teaches in English, and upon request, in German and Russian. </p>
