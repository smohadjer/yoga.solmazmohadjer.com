		<p>An avid athlete and outdoorsman, Peter's first experience with yoga came in 2010. He was drawn to the increased strength, flexibility, concentration and awareness that a dedicated yoga practice offers. For him, yoga has become a way of staying grounded and balanced. His teaching style is down to earth and slow-paced, with an emphasis on relaxation and mindfulness.</p>
