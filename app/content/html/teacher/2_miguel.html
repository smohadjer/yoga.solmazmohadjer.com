		<p>Miguel came into yoga by accident. He started practicing yoga as physical therapy to recover from injury and develop new strength, balance and flexibility for other sports and activities in his life. What began as physical routine in 2006 has transformed into daily meditation for well-being and happiness. His classes develop mindfulness of body and breath using simple poses and concentration techniques to build a robust and relaxing practice. Modifications are offered to provide the appropriate level of challenge and support to meet individual needs. In his teaching, Miguel aims to help others achieve their goals and find inspiration for new ones, all while expanding self-awareness and practicing peace, harmony and love.</p>
