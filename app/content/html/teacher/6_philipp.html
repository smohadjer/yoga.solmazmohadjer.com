		<p>Philipp started out on his Yoga and Meditation journey during his civil service in a school in Auroville, India. From then he continued to discover the treasure box of his body and mind system. Philipp loves taking inspiration from being in nature and living peacefully in the interplay of strain and ease during yoga classes. He had different teachers, notably from the Iyengar, Kaivalyadhama and Shivananda traditions. His teaching certificate is from a 4-weeks intensive training at Yoga Vidya in Bad Meinberg and continuous education. Being a long-term Vipassana practitioner, Philipp's classes are inspired by the self-awareness and concentration of meditation.</p>
