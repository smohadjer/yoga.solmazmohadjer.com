		<h2>Vinyasa Yoga at Clubhaus</h2>
		<p>Can't get enough of chaturanga to upward-facing dog to downward-facing dog? Then this class is for you! In this 90-minute session, you practice dynamic mediation by coordinating your body movement with your breath to flow from one pose to the next. The sequence starts with poses that focus on stretching and strengthening. We then turn our attention to joints, and later to organs where the sequence takes you through poses that improve blood circulation and alleviate congestion in the organs. Bring your own mat, and be ready to have some fun.</p>
