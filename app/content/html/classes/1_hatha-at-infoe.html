		<h2>Hatha Yoga at InFoe</h2>
		<p>This class is ideal for anyone new to yoga and interested in its benefits. It is designed to help students build strength, increase flexibility, find focus, and learn how to let go and relax. The class begins with the practice of breath awareness and simple breathing techniques and a warm-up sequence.  Students then follow a series of standing and floor postures (asanas) to prepare for exhilarating peak poses that are practiced later in class. The class then concludes with a series of cooling and calming postures that would bring students to complete relaxation. The class is moderately paced so that students can learn the fundamental yoga postures and principles that create a successful and effective yoga practice.</p>
