		<h2>Anapana Meditation</h2>
		<p>In this session, students practice Anapanasati or mindfulness of breathing by following instructions given by S.N. Goenka, a teacher of Vipassana meditation. Students learn how to use natural breathing to cultivate concentration and mindfulness. This practice prepares students for vipassana meditation which is taught in ten-day courses in the vipassana meditation centers all over the world. In this session, students practice Anapana in a quiet room for one hour, sitting with their back straight while maintaining complete silence throughout the entire session. The instructions will be given by audio recording of S.N. Goenka. There is no charge for attending this session.</p>
