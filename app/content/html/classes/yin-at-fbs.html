		<h2>Yin Yoga at Familien-Bildungsstaette</h2>
		<p>Would you like to sit more comfortably in meditation? This class is designed to increase the flexibility of the connective tissue around the joints, especially the hips, pelvis and lower spine. Students practice a variation of seated and supine poses, holding each pose for several minutes. Poses are based on classic yoga asanas, and are modified slightly to emphasize releasing muscles as oppose to contracting them. Students learn to enter slowly and gently into each pose, waiting for body feedback before moving deeper into the pose. This course complements hatha yoga practice by enhancing the natural range of mobility and energy flow in the tissues around the joints.</p>
