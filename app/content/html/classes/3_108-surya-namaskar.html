		<h2>108 Surya Namaskar: Celebrating the Changing of the Seasons</h2>
		<p>In this 90-minute session, students will elevate their yoga practice by challenging themselves both mentally and physically to complete 108 rounds of sun salutations to mark and celebrate the change of seasons. This session is recommended for intermediate and advanced students or those who can practice sun salutations safely. The rounds are performed continuously without a pause in between. When needed, students can rest in child pose or sit in meditation. Remember to bring a mat, a towel, and a bottle water, and be prepared to enjoy this meditative, magical and sweaty session!</p>
