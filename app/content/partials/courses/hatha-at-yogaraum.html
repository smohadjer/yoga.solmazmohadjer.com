		<h2>Hatha Chakra Flow</h2>
		<p>This class offers a balance of relaxation, exhilaration, and meditation in order to refresh the body, stimulate breath and circulation, as well as deepen the understanding of the physical, energetic and spiritual aspects of yoga. We begin with breath awareness, simple breathing techniques (Pranayama), followed by a warm-up and flow sequence in order to prepare for longer holds of specific postures (Asanas) that optimize key energy centers (Chakras). Visualization and Auto-suggestion exercises promote concentration and encourage students to explore inner aspects of their practice. Modifications are provided for different needs and experience levels.</p>
