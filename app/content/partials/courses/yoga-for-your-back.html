		<h2>Yoga for Your Back</h2>
		<p>This is a hatha yoga class that mainly targets your back. You will practice poses that can prevent and relieve symptoms associated with back problems. These poses are designed to ease tension not only in your back but also your hips, hamstrings, and inner legs. Each class starts with basic back stretches on the floor, followed by more movement that strengthens and stretches muscles supporting body posture and spine. The class ends with complete relaxation, breath awareness and meditation. The class is open to all levels.</p>
