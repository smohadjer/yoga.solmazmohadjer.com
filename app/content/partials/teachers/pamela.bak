		<p>Pamela Mena Romano had her first encounter with yoga in Chile in 2006. Passionate about sport and dance, she searched for a yoga style that could combines an energetically and physically challenging practice with an afterwards relaxed and calm body and mind.  In 2013, she found vinyasa yoga and immediately fell in love with how it cultivates inner awareness. In 2018, she became a vinyasa yoga teacher by completing the Yoga Alliance RYT-200 certified training with Nico Luce. In her teaching, she brings themes to the yoga practice that are related to inner awareness and self-love. She combines these themes with appropriate yoga postures, dance movements, and sometimes her singing of mantras to ensure maximum expression in her students. She believes that at some point in their practice, her students start to discover beautiful things inside themselves, that they may have never expected to find. Being a witness and having the possibility to accompany her students in this process, is what she loves the most about being a yoga teacher.</p>
