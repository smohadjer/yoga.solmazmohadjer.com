		<p>Inspired by BKS Iyengar, Aurelie teaches a unique form of hatha yoga developed by Master Sharat Arora. This method involves using props in order to maintain alignment and relaxation in all positions. Each asana grows from its foundation (for example, the feet in standing poses) after which natural alignment derives. This minimizes local movements of the trunk, bringing focus and actions in the foundations while keeping the abdomen relaxed. This approach draws the awareness inwards and allows for holding the posture sufficiently long to reach a state of peace and stability of the body and mind. Aurelie teaches in English (French and German upon request) and splits her time between Europe and India where she keeps learning from her teacher.
